# WaterParkSim

Is a demo project for learning to work with and use flutter for web and desktop applications.  

The demo simulates a SCADA system that controls a water injection facility. 

+ The application is a workspace widget that is split into a basic XML text editor and a display canvas.
+ The text editor recomputes the text as it is being entered then refreshes the display canvas with the result.
+ The play icon runs the simulation on the node tree.

## Current State

The current web version of this project may be found [here.](https://charlescarley.github.io/WaterParkSim/) 

It does not work well with mobile browsers at the moment do to the split layout 
screen and limited space.
