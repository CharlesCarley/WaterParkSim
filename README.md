# WaterParkSim

This is a demo project for learning to work with and use 
flutter for web and desktop targets.  

This demo simulates a SCADA system that controls a water injection facility. 

## Current State

The current web version of this project may be found [here.](https://charlescarley.github.io/WaterParkSim/) It does not work well with mobile browsers at the moment.



## Project Structure

The application is a workspace widget that is separated into a basic text editor and a display canvas.

The text editor recomputes the text as it is being entered then refreshes the display canvas with the result.
